# Challenge Examples

Interactive questions called "challenges" can be added to any markdown lesson to check for understanding. These same challenges can also be used to construct practice assignments, quizzes, and assessments.

## Examples of Each Type

* multiple choice (select one)
* checkbox (select multiple)
* short answer
* number
* paragraph
* code snippet--js, py, java, sql (code directly in Learn)
* project, testable project (code locally, submit a repo)



## Multiple Choice

Multiple Choice challenges allow a student to submit a single answer to a multiple-choice question.

<!----------------------BEGIN CHALLENGE----------------------------->

### !challenge

<!--'type' is required-->
<!--'id' is required, string, must be unique within a branch-->
<!--'title' is required, string, used when displaying results-->

* type: multiple-choice
* id: 4fb73ef6-1492-45c9-b937-fe718cb80fea
* title: Example Multiple Choice Challenge

<!--'question' is required, markdown, the question to be answered-->

### !question

Which of these cities is home to a Galvanize campus?

### !end-question

### !answer

Denver

### !end-answer

<!--'explanation' is optional. Shown after the student correctly answers the question.-->

### !end-challenge

<!----------------------END CHALLENGE----------------------------->




## Checkbox

Checkbox challenges allow a student to submit multiple answers to a multiple-choice question.

<!----------------------BEGIN CHALLENGE----------------------------->

### !challenge

* type: checkbox
* id: a2b0dd37-4d72-490f-ba26-c6e7b08d21a0

* Denver
* Los Angeles

##### !end-answer

### !end-challenge

<!----------------------END CHALLENGE----------------------------->



## Short Answer

Short-answer challenges allow a student to submit a short answer, usually a single word, as the answer to a question. By default, the answer is evaluated as a case-insensitive exact match, but can also be evaluated as a regex.

### !challenge

<!--'type' is required-->
<!--'id' is required, string, must be unique within a single markdown file-->
<!--'title' is required, string, used when displaying results-->

* type: short-answer
* id: 1a3cc34f-ea21-4533-bed4-6da3c8c95a4e
* title: Example Short Answer Challenge

<!--'question' is required, markdown, the question to be answered-->

### !question

What will the following code produce?

```javascript
var myArray = ["Elie", "Janey", "Matt", "Parker", "Tim"];
myArray[3]
```

### !end-question

<!--'placeholder' is optional, the placeholder text in the input box. Removed when the user starts typing-->

#### !placeholder

What does myArray[3] equal?

#### !end-placeholder

<!--'answer' is required, the correct answer to the question.
By default, answers evaluated as case-insensitive exact match. If answer wrapped in '/', evaluated as regex. The answer to this question could have been defined as /\A['"]Parker['"]$/ to allow students to enter single or double quotes. Also supports regex ending in '/i' for case-insensitive regex. To test your regex, you can use http://rubular.com/-->

### !answer
"Parker"
### !end-answer

### !end-challenge

<!----------------------END CHALLENGE----------------------------->



## Number

Number challenges allow a student to submit a number as the answer to a question. The answer is evaluated numerically, and the student can answer with a decimal or a fraction--so that things like 3/10, 30/100, .3, 0.3, 0.300 etc. are all equivalent. There also also an option when creating the challenge to define the precision used when the answer is scored -- see the code below for details.

<!----------------------BEGIN CHALLENGE----------------------------->

### !challenge

<!--'type' is required-->
<!--'id' is required, string, must be unique within a branch-->
<!--'title' is required, string, used when displaying results-->
<!--'decimal' is optional, the number of decimal places that the answer will be rounded to before evaluating for correctness. If not specified, answer must be exact.-->

* type: number
* id: e88f0c35-7f2d-4990-81c1-a529d5e81dbb
* title: Example Number Challenge
* decimal: 5

<!--'question' is required, markdown, the question to be answered-->

### !question
Suppose a card is drawn from a standard 52 card deck. What's the probability that the card is a queen?
### !end-question

### !answer
1/13
### !end-answer

### !end-challenge

<!----------------------END CHALLENGE----------------------------->



## Paragraph

Paragraph Challenges allow a student to submit a long free-form text answer to a question, such as a definition of explanation. The answers to these Challenges are not evaluated by Learn, but are available for the instructor to view.

<!----------------------BEGIN CHALLENGE----------------------------->

### !challenge

<!--'type' is required-->
<!--'id' is required, string, must be unique within a branch-->
<!--'title' is required, string, used when displaying results-->

## Javascript Code Snippet

Code Snippet Challenges allow a student to write code directly in Learn. The submission is evaluated against unit tests that are setup as part of the Challenge. The student then sees the standard output from the test runner in Learn.

<!----------------------BEGIN CHALLENGE----------------------------->

### !challenge

<!--'type' is required-->
<!--'id' is required, string, must be unique within a branch-->
<!--'language' is required for type: code-snippet. For javascript, use 'javascript' -->
<!--'title' is required, string, used when displaying results-->

* type: code-snippet
* id: dd9c31af-0fe8-440d-b4ec-bab3e8dc8a1d
* language: javascript18
* title: Javascript `Repeats` Function

<!--'question' is required, markdown, the question to be answered-->

### !question

## Repeats

Write a function named `repeats`
* `repeats` should take one argument, `str`, the string to test.
* For this exercise, you can assume that `str` is a string.
* If the first half of `str` equals the second half, return true.
* If `str` is an empty string, return true.
* Otherwise, return false.
* Do not use the `.repeat` method.

### !end-question

<!--'placeholder' is optional, the starting code in the editor. Not removed when the user starts typing-->

#### !placeholder

```js
function repeats(str) {
   // return str.substring(0, str.length/2) === str.substring(str.length/2, str.length);
}
```

#### !end-placeholder

<!--'tests' is required for code-snippets and contains the unit tests that will be run to evaluate the student submission. Tests should be broken down into as many 'it(should...)' blocks as possible, because this is how students will get results. -->

### !tests

```js
describe('repeats', function() {

    it("should return true when given an empty string (which seems strange, but go with it :) )", function() {
      expect(repeats(""), "Default value is incorrect").to.deep.eq(true)
    })

    it("should return true when the second half of the string equals the first", function() {
      expect(repeats("bahbah")).to.deep.eq(true)
      expect(repeats("nananananananana")).to.deep.eq(true)
    })

    it("should return false when the second half of the string does not equal the first", function() {
      expect(repeats("bahba")).to.deep.eq(false)
      expect(repeats("nananananann")).to.deep.eq(false)
    })

    it("should not use .repeat", function() {
      expect(repeats.toString()).to.not.match(/\.repeat/)
    })

})

## SQL Code Snippet

SQL Snippet Challenges allow a student to write SQL `SELECT` queries against a database defined by a curriculum developer. The submission is evaluated against a supplied test query. The student sees a truncated set of rows as if their query was run from the `psql` interpreter, and the challenge is graded against row and column matches, along with data matches. `ORDER BY` clauses will be respected if they are supplied in the test query.

The database used is:

`PostgreSQL 14.7 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu`

<!----------------------BEGIN CHALLENGE----------------------------->

## Project Challenge

Project Challenges allow a student to do work outside of Learn. After completing the work, the student submits a link (typically from Github) to the work that they did for tracking and review within Learn.

<!----------------------BEGIN CHALLENGE----------------------------->

### !challenge

<!--'type' is required-->
<!--'id' is required, string, must be unique within a branch-->

## Testable Project

Just like Project Challenges, but Learn will automatically run tests included in the repo and make the results available to the instructor.

To do this, you need two things --

1. An exercise repo that is setup to run in Docker (covered [here](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/667/blocks/13/content_files/Testing-Project-Challenges.md)).
2. A project challenge where the students can submit their exercise repo.
